My Web Development Portfolio
Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my web development portfolio! This collection showcases the projects I've worked on during my time at Prodigy Infotech and beyond, highlighting my journey and growth in the field. Each project demonstrates my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, with a focus on creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.

Iâ€™ve included details about my academic background, including my BTech CGPA, and my performance in 10th and intermediate education. This portfolio not only reflects my technical abilities but also my passion for continuous learning and improvement.
